# My Portfolio
This is my portfolio, there are many like it but this one is mine.

## Description 
Given an existing image of a portfolio website, my task was to imitate the image and create a responsive portfolio using Bootstrap. This site contains an About Me page, a Portfolio page showcasing some of my interests and a Contact page should a user wish to communicate with me.

              <p>Now this is a story all about how
                My life got flipped turned upside down
                And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there
                I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>In West Philadelphia born and raised
                On the playground is where I spent most of my days
                Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool
                And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
                When a couple of guys who were up to no good
                Started making trouble in my neighborhood
                I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
                And said "You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"
                I begged and pleaded with her day after day
                But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
                She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
                I put my Walkman on and said "I might as well kick it"
                First class, yo, this is bad
                Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass
                Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
                Hmm, this might be all right
                But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, and all that
                Is this the type of place that they should send this cool cat?
                I don't think so, I'll see when I get there
                I hope they're prepared for the Prince of Bel-Air
